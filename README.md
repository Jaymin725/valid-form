# valid-form

This is my form validation project.
In this project, user will enter user-name, e-mail and password.
Then by using JavaScript, we have to validate the input-values.

## Input values

- user-name:
	- It should only be in number.
	- The number should be 10 digits long.

- e-mail:
	- It should follow proper e-mail format

- password:
	- It should be 8 characters long.
	- It should contain characters, number, and also special characters.

> [!Note]
> I'm using **Regular Expressions** for validating the input-values.
